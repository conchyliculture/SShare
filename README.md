# SShare

Simply push files from your Android phone to a remote server through SFTP/SCP.

## About

The goal is to stop depending on crapstacks of PHP bloated software to transfert files from your phone to your SSH reachable box on the internet.

The app registers into your "Share" quick menu, where you select one of all the Connections you've configure. The file will the be pushed to your box using [JSch](www.jcraft.com/jsch/).
